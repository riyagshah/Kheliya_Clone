Our Team was given the Project for Kheliya Toys and we were given a week’s time to complete the project. We were excited and a bit nervous at the same time as it is my first time working on a project and also we did not have any experience working in a team and completing everything within a given time frame. Being patient and focused helped us a lot to figure out what to do and how exactly to apply all the learnings that we did in this unit. By Planning and dividing the work efficiently we started our work.
